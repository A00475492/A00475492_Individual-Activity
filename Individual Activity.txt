One of the most beautiful and peaceful place I have ever visited in Sinhgad fort situated in Pune, Maharashtra. It is approxmiately 40 kms drive from my home, and it has a hike of 2 hours. I like that place of it's peaceful nature and as it has very rich history about Shubedhar Tanhaji Malusare and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.
